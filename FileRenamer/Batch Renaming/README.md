#Batch renaming of Files

This script does batch renaming of the files in a specified directory.
The script sorts the files in the directory alphabetically in a human sorting order
and renames the files according to your new naming convention.

Currently, the files are renamed with suffixes of 3 leading integer positions
i.e. 001, 102, 999

To modify the leading zeroes, line 50 can be commented out.
Alternatively, one could modify the leading zeroes, or the number naming convention.
